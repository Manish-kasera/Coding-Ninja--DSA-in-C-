Hurray! Correct Answer
Solution Description
p points to a. q points to p directly and a through p (double pointer). *q â€” value stored in p is changed to address of b instead of that of a. (*p)++ â€” value that p points to, which now is of b, is incremented by 1 (b becomes 21). Value of a remains unchanged.
