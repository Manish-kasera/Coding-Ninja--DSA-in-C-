Fill the output

What is the output of the following program?
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define MULTIPLY(a, b) a*b

int main(){
    cout << MULTIPLY(2+3, 3+5);
    return 0;
}

Answer
16
Correct Answer
Solution Description
"MULTIPLY(a, b)" will be replaced by "a*b" in code.
So, MULTIPLY(2+3, 3+5) will be replaced by 2+3*3+5. And according to operator precedence, multiply operator (*) has higher precedence than plus operator (+). 
So, 3*3 will be evaluated first. Hence expression will become :
2+9+5 = 16
